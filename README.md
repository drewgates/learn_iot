# Learn Electronics and IoT

Hey! I'm assembling a list of useful skills for designing Electronics/IoT devices for the non-Engineer. Learn links identify places to pick up these skills. Several of these are resources that have served me well over the past few years. In some cases, links are temporary (result of skill #1) as I identify best resources for some topics. 

Have a better suggestion? Feel free to open an issue or PR. 

Skill List:

* How to Google. [Seriously](https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/23-google-search-tips-youll-want-to-learn).

* Circuits and Breadboarding [Learn](https://www.smraza.com/pages/toturial)
  * We use the Smraza S32 kit at MakerspaceCT and Spark Makerspace. It's not perfect, but it is adequate and inexpensive and it includes the T-Cobbler board for breaking out the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins.

* File management and revision history: git with github lfs. ([Learn](https://dangitgit.com/en))

* Arduino Fundamentals ([Learn](https://github.com/makerspacect/arduino_intro))

* MicroPython Fundamentals

* Raspberry Pi Fundamentals ([Learn](https://github.com/makerspacect/raspberry_pi_intro))

* MQTT with WiFi ([Learn](https://codetober.com/temperature-and-humidity-with-esp32/))

* Helium Packets ([Learn](https://github.com/MakerspaceCT/ttgo_esp32_helium))

* MQTT with Helium, LoRaWAN ([Learn](https://www.hackster.io/uFire/helium-water-quality-monitor-075e6d))

* Sensors!

  * [Adafruit Generic](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Sensor)

  * [Split Core Current](https://github.com/maxux/current-arduino)

* Sourcing components (DigiKey, Mouser, LCSC, Amazon, AliExpress, Banggood)

* PCB Design with KiCAD ([Learn](https://wiki.ai03.com/books/pcb-design/chapter/pcb-designer-guide))

* DRC, Gerbers, and PCB sourcing ([JLCPCB Capabilities](https://jlcpcb.com/capabilities/Capabilities))

* CAD and Additive Fundamentals for enclosure design. (but first: will one of [these](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Carlon-4-in-x-4-in-x-2-in-PVC-Junction-Box-Gray-E989NNJ-CAR/100404097) work?)

* PCB validation and revision

* Soldering and circuit assembly. ( [Learn THT](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-guide-excellent-soldering) / Learn SMD )

* Data aggregation and visualization ([Learn](https://support.machineq.com/s/article/MQTT-Tutorial), not sure this is best tutorial)

* IoT Industry, Past, Present, and Future.

* Assembling a Portfolio
